# EC423
This repository contains all of my assignments from Econometrics 1, including the final "Blog Post." I took this class during the Fall 2024 quarter at the University of Oregon

The Blog Post is essentially a mini-thesis in which I explore and analyze a relationship of my choosing.

All other files are homework assignments.
